** This testcase demonstrates the syntactic correctness of the constructs such as modules, simple and declaration statements, and expressions**

<<<driver program>>>
start
	declare a,b,c,d,e:integer;
	declare f:boolean;
	declare arr: array [1..3] of integer;
	a := -3;
	a := b;
	a := arr[1];
	a := -(2+3);
	f := true;
	f := true AND f;
	a := 4 + 2;
	a := 44 * (b-c);
	a := 44 * c * e;
	** do not bother that the last variable is not declared. It will be taken care of later in the semantic analysis phase**
end

**verify the output of the lexical analyzer as well**
**check the correctness of the parse tree**
