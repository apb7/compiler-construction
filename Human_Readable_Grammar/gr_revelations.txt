DRIVERDEF

New nonterminal symbols used to modify the grammar are as follows:
	<N1>
	<N2>
	<N3>
	<N4>
	<N5>
	<N7>
	<N8>
	<N9>
	<caseStmts> (in place of <caseStmt>)

	<op1>
	<op2>
	<arithmeticOrBooleanExpr>
	<AnyTerm>

at least one case


a. Add any new rule (given during online test) in `./data/gr_hr.txt` after removing left recursion (and left factoring).
b. Then run the script to get comma delimited grammar as in `./data/grammar.txt`.

Here (in a.), you need to make sure that no two rules collide (in terms of having the same first sets), e.g.,
I. [Before removing left recursion]
1. <arithmeticExpr> -> <arithmeticExpr> <op1> <term>
2. <arithmeticExpr> -> <term>

II. [After removing left recursion]
1. <arithmeticExpr> -> <term> <N4>
2. <N4> -> <op1> <term> <N4> | Îµ


I made this mistake to also include `<arithmeticExpr> -> <term>` in the II. and that led to this rule and II. 1. having same first which makes the grammar non-LL(1). 

If you do everything carefully, there's nothing to worry. I am just saying that this is an important step which we do manually. So, just take care.
